## 🎯 Improvement Domains

| Domain | Focus | Metrics |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Data Quality** | Scraper accuracy, normalization, dedup | Error rate, field completeness |
| **Data Coverage** | More retailers, products, brands | % of NYS market captured |
| **Performance** | API latency, dashboard speed | p95 response time |
| **Reliability** | Error handling, retries, monitoring | Uptime, failed scrapes |
| **UX** | Dashboard usability, data presentation | User friction points |

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

### Data Quality Score (0-100)
- Field completeness: % of products with THC%, price, category
- Normalization accuracy: Brand name matching rate
- Freshness: % of data < 24h old

### Coverage Score (0-100)
- Retailer coverage: Active retailers / Total NYS licensed (593)
- Product coverage: Unique products tracked
- Geographic spread: Regions with >= 3 retailers

### Performance Score (0-100)
- API p95 latency < 200ms = 100 pts
- Dashboard load < 2s = 100 pts
- Convex query p95 < 100ms = 100 pts

## 🤖 Sub-Agent Roles

1. **Evaluator** - Runs tests, measures metrics, identifies gaps
2. **Data Worker** - Scraper improvements, normalization fixes
3. **Perf Worker** - Load testing, optimization
4. **UX Worker** - Dashboard improvements, UI polish

## 📊 Baseline Scores (2026-02-17)

| Metric | Score | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Data Quality** | 45/100 | Schema excellent, but no data in production Convex yet. Test scrapes show product names have concatenated metadata, inventory counts unavailable |
| **Coverage** | 15/100 | 593 NYS dispensaries identified, but only 1 successfully scraped. Dutchie covers ~4% (25/593), most use custom menus |
| **Performance** | 40/100 | Convex & browser worker healthy, dashboard built but in demo mode. No load testing |

### Key Findings

**✅ What's Working:**
- Convex backend deployed & healthy (`quick-weasel-225.convex.site/health`)
- Browser worker deployed & healthy (`cannasignal-browser.prtl.workers.dev/health`)
- Well-designed schema with normalization, snapshots, analytics tables
- Dashboard scaffolding with React/Vite/Tailwind/Convex
- Stealth scraper bypasses Cloudflare on embedded Dutchie menus
- 54 products extracted from ConBud LES test scrape

**⚠️ Issues Found:**
- Direct Dutchie.com URLs blocked (Housing Works = 0 products)
- Product names contain concatenated metadata (THC%, strain type mixed in)
- Inventory counts not captured (all 54 products show `inventoryCount: null`)
- Dashboard runs in DEMO mode (no `VITE_CONVEX_URL` configured)
- No data actually ingested to Convex tables yet
- Only 13 Dutchie + 79 custom menu retailers mapped

**🔴 Blockers:**
1. Most NYS retailers use custom menus, not scrapable Dutchie
2. Scraper data not flowing to Convex (pipeline incomplete)
3. Product name parsing needs work before useful analytics

## 📝 Improvement Log

### 2026-02-17 — DATA-005: Product Normalization Complete
**Worker:** Subagent (cannasignal-worker-data005)

Created `convex/lib/productNormalizer.ts`:
- Parses concatenated DOM-scraped names like `"Grocery | 28g Flower - Sativa | Black DieselGrocerySativaTHC: 29.21%"`
- Extracts: clean name, brand, category, strain, THC/CBD/TAC percentages, weight, tags
- Handles edge cases: duplicate brand names, "Staff Pick" badges, various weight formats
- Returns confidence score for parsing quality

Integrated into `convex/ingestion.ts`:
- Products now store clean names and structured THC/CBD ranges
- Better strain type and category detection

Test results: **10/10 real scrape samples pass**

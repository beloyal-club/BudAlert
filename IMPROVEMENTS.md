## 🤖 Sub-Agent Roles

1. **Evaluator** - Runs tests, measures metrics, identifies gaps
2. **Data Worker** - Scraper improvements, normalization fixes
3. **Perf Worker** - Load testing, optimization
4. **UX Worker** - Dashboard improvements, UI polish

---

## 📊 Baseline Scores (2026-02-17)

| Metric | Score | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Data Quality** | 45/100 | Schema excellent, but no data in production Convex yet. Test scrapes show product names have concatenated metadata, inventory counts unavailable |
| **Coverage** | 15/100 | 593 NYS dispensaries identified, but only 1 successfully scraped. Dutchie covers ~4% (25/593), most use custom menus |
| **Performance** | 40/100 | Convex & browser worker healthy, dashboard built but in demo mode. No load testing |

### Key Findings

**✅ What's Working:**
- Convex backend deployed & healthy (`quick-weasel-225.convex.site/health`)
- Browser worker deployed & healthy (`cannasignal-browser.prtl.workers.dev/health`)
- Well-designed schema with normalization, snapshots, analytics tables
- Dashboard scaffolding with React/Vite/Tailwind/Convex
- Stealth scraper bypasses Cloudflare on embedded Dutchie menus
- 54 products extracted from ConBud LES test scrape

**⚠️ Issues Found:**
- Direct Dutchie.com URLs blocked (Housing Works = 0 products)
- Product names contain concatenated metadata (THC%, strain type mixed in)
- Inventory counts not captured (all 54 products show `inventoryCount: null`)
- Dashboard runs in DEMO mode (no `VITE_CONVEX_URL` configured)
- No data actually ingested to Convex tables yet
- Only 13 Dutchie + 79 custom menu retailers mapped

**🔴 Blockers:**
1. Most NYS retailers use custom menus, not scrapable Dutchie
2. Scraper data not flowing to Convex (pipeline incomplete)
3. Product name parsing needs work before useful analytics

## 📝 Improvement Log

### 2026-02-17 — REL-002: Scraper Alerting System Complete
**Worker:** Cron Improvement Worker (Cycle 15)

**Summary:**
Implemented comprehensive scraper alerting to proactively detect and notify on scraper issues.

**New Module - `convex/scraperAlerts.ts`:**
- **Alert Conditions:**
  - `new_failures` - Triggers when 3+ new dead letter queue entries in last hour
  - `high_failure_rate` - Triggers when >20% of scrape jobs fail
  - `stale_scraper` - Triggers when 3+ retailers haven't been scraped in 6+ hours
  - `rate_limit_spike` - Triggers when 5+ rate limit (429) errors in last hour
- **Severity Levels:** low, medium, high, critical (based on thresholds)
- **Cooldown:** 30-minute minimum between alerts of same type
- **Discord Webhook:** Rich embeds with emoji indicators, summary stats

**Queries/Mutations:**
- `checkAlertConditions` - Evaluate all conditions without sending
- `getAlertHistory` - Get past alerts with filtering
- `getLastAlerts` - Cooldown checking

- `acknowledgeAlert` - Mark alert as handled
- `getAlertDigest` - Dashboard summary

**Actions:**
- `checkAndAlert` - Full check + optional Discord delivery

**HTTP Endpoints (`convex/http.ts`):**
- `POST /alerts/check` - Trigger alert check, optionally send
- `GET /alerts/digest` - Dashboard summary
- `GET /alerts/conditions` - Current condition status
- `GET /alerts/history` - Alert history
- `POST /alerts/webhook-test` - Test Discord webhook

**Dashboard Component - `AlertPanel.tsx`:**
- Real-time alert conditions with severity colors
- Pulsing animation for critical alerts
- Recent alert history with inline acknowledgment
- Summary stats grid (errors, rate limits, stale, jobs/hr)
- `AlertStatusBadge` for nav integration

**Schema Changes:**
- New `scraperAlerts` table with indexes by type, severity, acknowledged, time

**CLI Script - `scripts/alert-test.ts`:**
- `check` - View current conditions
- `digest` - Get dashboard summary

### 2026-02-17 — PERF-002: Stats Cache Layer Complete
**Worker:** Cron Improvement Worker (Cycle 11)

**Summary:**
Implemented precomputed stats cache for O(1) dashboard queries instead of counting all records on every call.

**Schema Changes:**
- `convex/schema.ts`: New `statsCache` table with:
  - `key` (indexed) - "global" or regional keys
  - `retailers` - total, active, byRegion breakdown
  - `brands` - total, verified counts
  - `inventory` - totalRecords, uniqueProducts, inStock, outOfStock
  - `scrapeHealth` - unresolvedErrors, totalJobs24h, successfulJobs24h
  - `computedAt`, `version` - cache metadata

**New Module - `convex/cache.ts`:**
- `getStats` - O(1) cache lookup with TTL check
- `getStatsWithFallback` - Cache with live computation fallback
- `refreshGlobalCache` - Full cache recomputation
- `incrementRetailerCount` - Incremental update on retailer insert
- `incrementBrandCount` - Incremental update on brand insert
- `updateInventoryCount` - Incremental inventory updates
- `updateScrapeHealth` - Update error counts
- `getCacheInfo` - Cache debugging/status

**HTTP Endpoints (`convex/http.ts`):**
- `POST /cache/refresh` - Trigger cache refresh
- `GET /cache/info` - Get cache status

**Dashboard Integration:**
- `convex/dashboard.ts`: `getStats` now checks cache first (5-min TTL)
- Falls back to live computation if cache stale/missing
- Returns `fromCache: true/false` for transparency

**Performance Impact:**
- Dashboard stats: O(n) → O(1) when cache is fresh
- Cache TTL: 5 minutes (configurable)
- Incremental updates available for real-time accuracy

**Blocker:**
- Requires `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` to deploy schema changes
- Test script created: `scripts/cache-test.ts`

### 2026-02-17 — DATA-001: Scraper Validation Complete
**Worker:** Subagent (budalert-worker-data001)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Product normalizer: 10/10 test cases pass
- ✅ Field extraction: THC, price, brand, strain, weight all accurate
- ❌ Direct dutchie.com URLs blocked by Cloudflare
- ❌ Browser worker times out (lacks stealth capability)
- ✅ Embedded menus on retailer domains work with stealth Playwright
- ❌ Inventory counts unavailable (all null) - Dutchie doesn't expose

**Fixes Made:**
- `convex/lib/productNormalizer.ts`: Added cannabis weight → flower category inference
  - "Quarter Ounce" format now correctly categorized as flower
  - Weights in 1-28g range inferred as flower

**Architecture Gap Identified:**
- Local stealth Playwright works but can't run in CF Workers
- Need self-hosted browser pool or BrowserBase for production
